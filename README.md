# snowflake-utils
This repository contains lightweight frameworks designed to automate specific tasks within the Snowflake environment, built as reusable code snippets.
I will be updating this space with documentation to help you understand and navigate the code snippets. The current focus is on implementing the same framework using multiple approaches like using  Snowflake native features via Snowflake Stored Procedures written in SQL, Snowflake Stored Procedures written in JavaScript, and Stand alone Python.
